An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 &times; 3

Example 2:


Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 &times; 2 &times; 2


Example 3:


Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.


Example 4:


Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.


 
Constraints:


	-231 <= n <= 231 - 1
