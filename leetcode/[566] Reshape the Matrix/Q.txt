In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

 
Example 1:


Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]


Example 2:


Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]


 
Constraints:


	m == mat.length
	n == mat[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 100
	-1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000
	1 <= r, c <= 300
