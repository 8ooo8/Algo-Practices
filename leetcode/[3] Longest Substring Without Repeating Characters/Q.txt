Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 
Example 1:

Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.


Example 2:


Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.


Example 3:


Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
