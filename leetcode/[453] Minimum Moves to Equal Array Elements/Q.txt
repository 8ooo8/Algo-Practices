Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0


 
Constraints:


	n == nums.length
	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
	The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
