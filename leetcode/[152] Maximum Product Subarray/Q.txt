Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:


Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.


Example 2:


Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
