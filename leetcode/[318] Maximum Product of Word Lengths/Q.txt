Given a string array words, return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

 
Example 1:


Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".


Example 2:


Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".


Example 3:


Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such pair of words.


 
Constraints:


	2 <= words.length <= 1000
	1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
	words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
