Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]


Example 2:


Input: root = []
Output: []


Example 3:


Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100


 
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
